        <p>
            I like reading science and history books though I like fiction too.
            I usually read when I have some spare time like when I finish my work.
            The teachers in class let me read when I finish all my work.
            I am In 7th grade and I am 12 years old . I know that reading is a good habit that helps the brain, and it makes us better people .
